# drawio-beachy-dreams-style
An 80's Neon Beach Aesthetic for your [drawio](https://app.diagrams.net/) wireframes and diagrams.

I ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è drawio.

I use it for all my diagrams. It's also free and available for web or desktop, so you can access it from anywhere. There's even an [Obsidian plugin](https://github.com/zapthedingbat/drawio-obsidian) for creating diagrams with it.

But, as with so many tools, my technical diagrams were looking a bit stale üò¶

I wanted to give them a fresh look, and what better than an 80's neon beach aesthetic to make them pop? ‚ú®üï∂Ô∏è‚ú®

Well, whichever developer added the ability to style drop shadows earlier this year made my dream come true.

I present: the _**Beach Dreams**_ style for drawio. It comes in two neon flavors: Bold Beach and Creamy Beach. Bold Beach is a bit more vibrant, while Creamy Beach is a bit more pastel.

As always with neons, some colors will be less ideal for things like text or small details, so keep that in mind.

## Colors

Here are the Colors to replicate. Open the Properties pane & set shadow x & y offsets to 0, shadow opacity to 100, and shadow blur to 5 to achieve the same look.
